								<p>
									In traditional IoT scenarios, Specific-Purpose Sensor (SPS) or Distributed Multi-Sensor (DMS) are usually deployed directly on different locations or objects to sense diverse purposes, However, the number of sensing purposes always conflict with the complexity of networking and deployment. Integrated Multi-Sensor Tag (IMST) alleviates this problem, such as Texas Instruments <i>SimpleLink SensorTag</i>, and Laput's <i>Synthetic Sensors</i>, with multiple sensors integrated on a small board to indirectly monitor a large context,  without direct instrumentation of objects. But due to the limited computing power of IMST, a large amount of raw data still needs to be sent to the remote server for processing through wireless technologies such as <i>Bluetooth</i> or <i>WiFi</i>, which may lead to processing delays, data leakage or intrusion.
								</p>

								<h3 class="mt-4">METHOD</h3>

								<p>
									In this work, we explore the concept of <strong>Edge Computing Sensor Kit (ECSK)</strong> based on the former work. We designed a new type of hardware that integrates several different types of sensors, including a camera and a microphone, on a small board, while adding a powerful processor and Tensor Processing Unit, which allows algorithmic models and applications to run directly on it instead of on a remote server. Each sensor has a task channel, and multiple sensors can independently perform data sampling and feature extraction with concurrency. Feature data from different sensor channels are used to achieve real-time recognition of general activities in the environment (e.g., robotic arm movement) by a machine learning based multi-sensor information fusion algorithm.

									RESULT
								</h3>
								<p>
									After deploying ECSK in many types of scenarios (e.g. industrial scenarios), the results show that the complexity of networking and deployment is reduced compared to SPS and DMS, and operators only need to power on the ECSK to make it work without any other additional operations, and the accuracy and robustness of real-time activity recognition are improved due to effective multi-sensor information fusion algorithm. In addition, compared to IMST, the transmission of large amounts of raw data between it and the remote servers is no longer required, which improves system responsiveness and reduces the risk of data compromise and intrusion. Further, the user experience is enhanced by the combination of ECSK with data visualization and digital twin technology.
								</p>

								<p>
									ECSK can sense, process, and recognize the general activities happening in the environment in real-time like a human, which will have a positive impact on the future IoT, Industry 4.0, Autonomous Driving, Health Care, and other related fields.
