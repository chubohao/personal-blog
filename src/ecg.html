							<h4>
								BACKGROUND
							</h4>
							<p>
								We know that in the construction site area, construction workers must wear helmets to guard against falling objects. But even though supervisors give this requirement to construction workers, someone always forgets or chooses not to wear a helmet for various reasons, which brings great safety risks to his life. Previously, supervisors often patrolled regularly to detect whether each person was wearing a helmet correctly, but this was time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the supervisors were unable to monitor in real time. Therefore, they want to be able to use visual computing to determine whether construction workers are wearing helmets, and if someone is found not wearing a helmet, a warning will be issued.
							</p>

							<h4>
								MOTIVATION
							</h4>
							<p>
								Object recognition or action recognition based on visual computing has received a lot of attention and made great progress, such as ImageNet, YOLO, and so on. However, this area is still full of many challenges, such as how to improve the speed of video transmission, the speed of model recognition, and the generalization ability of models. This work will focus on these problems and implement a vision gateway based on image recognition.

								<h3 class="mt-4">METHOD</h3>

								<p>
									In this work, we explore the concept of <strong>Edge Computing Sensor Kit (ECSK)</strong> based on the former work. We designed a new type of hardware that integrates several different types of sensors, including a camera and a microphone, on a small board, while adding a powerful processor and Tensor Processing Unit, which allows algorithmic models and applications to run directly on it instead of on a remote server. Each sensor has a task channel, and multiple sensors can independently perform data sampling and feature extraction with concurrency. Feature data from different sensor channels are used to achieve real-time recognition of general activities in the environment (e.g., robotic arm movement) by a machine learning based multi-sensor information fusion algorithm.
