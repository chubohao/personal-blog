								<p>
									With the development of technology and the increase in application demand, the research and development and application of logistics robots are gradually being emphasized globally, and the traditional industrial intelligent manufacturing abroad, as well as Amazon and other Internet giants, are successively laying out logistics robots. Logistics robots are also gradually recognized as an important intelligent infrastructure in the process of digitization and automation of logistics and supply chain related enterprises.
								</p>
								<p>
									China's logistics robot market reached 12.6 billion yuan in 2021, up 63.64% year-on-year. The downstream applications of logistics robots are mainly in the automotive industry and home appliance manufacturing, accounting for 24% and 22% respectively. E-commerce warehousing and logistics, tobacco manufacturing, 3C electronics, and food and beverage accounted for 15%, 15%, 13%, and 6%, respectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									China's mobile robot (AGV/AMR) industry alliance data, new strategy mobile robot industry research institute statistics show that China's fork mobile robot (including vision navigation) sales reached 8000 units in 2021, a year-on-year growth of 60%, the market size of about 2.45 billion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 42.40%. From the distribution of product categories, in 2021, the laser has reflective plate forklift is still the mainstream market application, accounting for 69%, followed by SLAM navigation unmanned forklift, in some of the high degree of flexibility requirements of the robot scene gradually penetrate, accounting for 23%.
								</p>
								
								<h4 class="mt-4">MOTIVATION</h4>
								<p>
									In traditional logistics, it is often necessary to manually sort packages that are destined for different regions and then pulled away by trucks. This is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also difficult to track, which is why Libiao is one of the best logistics robotics sorting companies that have emerged around the world.
								</p>
								<p>
									Libiao Robotics Co., Ltd. is the world's first intelligent sorting robot and the world's leading supplier of flexible intelligent sorting solutions, creating the world's first portable, modular, automated cell sorting system, the company integrates the research and development, production, and sales of logistics automation and intelligent equipment.
								</p>
								<p class="text-primary">
									The cooperation between Libiao and the University of Essen in Duisburg gave me the opportunity to get in touch with objects and deploy logistics robots.
								</p>

								<h3 class="mt-4">METHOD</h3>
								<h4>
									Logistics Trolley Positioning and Orientation
								</h4>
								<p>
									In the activity area of the logistics trolley, there are a number of 45*45cm large black rubber mats laid out. Each rubber mat is submerged in a RFID tag, while the rubber mat carries magnetic, mat back red arrow points to the North Pole. Logistics trolley has a RFID reader, whenever the logistics trolley passes through the mat word, you can read the mat RFID tags, so you can know where they are located. Logistics trolley can determine the direction of the trolley by judging the magnetic field.
								</p>

								<h4>
									Data Transmission
								</h4>
								<p>
									The logistics system runs on a PC, how do the carts communicate with the system? There is a WiFi module on each hour, and the carts interact with the system through the WiFi module.
								</p>

								
								<h4>
									Pickup and Unloading
								</h4>
								<p>
									In the activity area of the trolley, you can designate several of them as pickup areas and several others as unloading areas according to your needs (which need to be set through the system software). There is a camera above the pickup area to scan the QR code or barcode of the parcel to determine which unloading port the parcel needs to be sent to.
								</p>

								<h4>
									Route Planning
								</h4>
								<p>
									Route planning is at the heart of the whole system and the core competence of a home company. Therefore, we can't know the specific information. But there are already many excellent path planning algorithms, such as RRT,A*, Elastic band and so on. When dealing with path planning, we first consider collision prevention, and then consider the problem of path shortest.
								</p>



								


								<h3 class="mt-4">
									RESULT
								</h3>
								<p>
									We tested the Libao logistics trolley system in a lab environment, and the results showed that through robotic sorting, each trolley can sort 1,500 packages per day in an 8*6 room, and 10 carts can run on the upper and lower floors.
